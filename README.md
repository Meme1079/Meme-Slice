# Meme-Slice
A shitty version of P-Slice and a fork of PsychEngine, that's literally it.

# About
No this isn't a replacement or a competitor to P-Slice, literally use that engine instead of this. This only exist so I can have a learning experience for programming so I can actually get better at it. And this might help me in computer science classes in the near future when I'm in college. Furthermore I want to add some unqiue features to differentiate P-Slice and other "Engines".

Plus I want to try something new like Haxe, I've been coding in Lua for 4 years now. I just need a bit of new in my life so it doesn't become stale. Anyways you check my weird ass code I made, idk just look at it and be in awe or smth.
